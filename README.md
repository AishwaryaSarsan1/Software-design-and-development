# Smart Nutrition And Food Management
## Objective
This project aims to develop a Smart Nutrition and Food Management System that tackles food wastage and promotes a balanced diet. It combines food inventory management, expiry notifications, calorie tracking, and innovative recipe suggestions into one platform. The system helps users, such as students, families, health-conscious individuals, and small businesses, manage groceries efficiently and make healthier food choices. The system allows users, students, families, health-conscious individuals, and small companies to manage groceries efficiently and make healthier food choices. We will use technologies like PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and third-party APIs for nutrition and recipes to build and implement the system within a semester.The solution addresses the everyday challenges of food waste and dietary management in a practical and user-friendly way.

## Problem Statement:
Food waste is a prevalent problem that results from forgetting grocery expiration dates, which can have an adverse effect on the environment and create needless financial loss. At the same time, it might be difficult for those who like to lead healthy lives to properly track their caloric intake and nutritional balance. Existing solutions, such calorie-tracking applications or food expiration reminders, usually deal with these concerns independently; however, no single system addresses both issues.
## Proposed Solution: 
A cutting edge web application called Smart Nutrition and Food Management assists users in eating better and wasting less. It tracks daily caloric intake, offers grocery expiration alerts, and recommends recipes with goods that are about to expire. Combining food management with nutrition tracking delivers a practical, user-friendly solution to two everyday problems in a single platform. 
## Target Users: 
**Students & Families**:  To organize groceries and reduce waste. 

**Health-conscious individuals**:  To track calorie intake and nutrition. 

**Fitness enthusiasts**:  Monitor diet closely to achieve fitness goals. 

**Small restaurants/cafes**:  To manage stock efficiently and cut losses. 
## Key Features: 
- **Food Inventory and Expiry Tracking:** Users will be able to record food items as soon as they are bought using the app's digital inventory system. Better organization is made possible by the ability to classify items into storage kinds like pantry, freezer, and refrigerator. When an item is about to expire, the system will promptly notify users and automatically check the shelf life of the items kept. This feature ensures that users are reminded to consume food before it spoils, significantly reducing household and commercial food wastage.
