Smart Nutrition
## Brief Overview
Smart Nutrition is a web-based nutrition management system that helps users:

2.  Log daily meals with calorie and macronutrient information.
3.  Visualize calorie consumption against a daily goal using charts.
4.  Receive recipe recommendations based on available ingredients.
5.  Manage profile measurements (height, weight, BMI) and auto-derive calorie goals
6.  Reset passwords securely using email-based OTP (One-Time Password).
The application is built with PHP (backend), MySQL (database), HTML/CSS/JS (frontend), and uses PHPMailer for OTP email delivery and Chart.js for dashboards.
